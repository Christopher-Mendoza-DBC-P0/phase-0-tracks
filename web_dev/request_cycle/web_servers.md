# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

## An operating system, by its nature, embodies the philosophy of its creators... The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing. (source: Mike Gancarz)

# In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

## A VPS is a computer that acts and feels like it's own computer but doesn't have the associated hardware attached to it. It is usually less expensive tha a full dedicated physical server. You can also easily scale up.

# Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

## You could accidentally disrupt the core OS of your VPS or whatever you're running linux on. Even the best programmers make mistakes.
