version control allows you to make changes to a core program without messing up the current program. It's useful because you can roll back to a previous version if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is something that is created to do new work or update work on a program. You would use this to maintain the integerity of a working program.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is placing a file that is ready to be merged into the program.  A good commit message is specific. ie ("With this commit I...")
